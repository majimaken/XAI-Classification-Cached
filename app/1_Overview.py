st.markdown("""
I created this app using Streamlit that uses a machine learning technique called XGBoost 
to classify data. XGBoost is more complex than other techniques, which can make it difficult 
for people to understand.

I made this app as part of my specialization project of the Master of Science in Engineering, 
and it allows users to explore XGBoost and see how it makes predictions. By visualizing the data set and
and feature importances, users can gain insight into how the model works and what factors influence its predictions.

Ultimately, my goal is to help more people understand machine learning techniques like XGBoost and make them 
more accessible to a wider audience.

st.markdown("""
This app provides an overview of the XGBoost algorithm used for a classification problem. 
The model is trained using the Bank Marketing Dataset from UCI,
which is an imbalanced dataset containing client information and whether a customer subscribed to a term depot or not. 

Please play around with different input variables and see how the model behaves! ðŸ˜Š
